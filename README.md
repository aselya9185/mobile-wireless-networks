## MWNDict.m
The MWNDict.m file contains a comprehensive collection of variables, formulas, and their variations, along with detailed explanations. This file serves as a valuable reference for understanding the mathematical models and concepts implemented in the project. It can be used to quickly look up key formulas and their interpretations to aid in better understanding the code and its underlying principles.

## InterferenceComputation.m
The InterferenceComputation.m file is a simulation tool provided by Professor Andrea Detti to compute the Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) for both uplink and downlink communication scenarios. It simulates the impact of interference in a wireless network based on the deployment of base stations and users. It accounts for sectoring, channel reuse, and power control mechanisms.

This file can be used to simulate and analyze interference in cellular systems, helping to understand the impact of different parameters such as cell load, power control, and sectoring on the overall system performance.
