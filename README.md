## MWNDict.m File
The MWNDict.m file contains a comprehensive collection of variables, formulas, and their variations, along with detailed explanations. This file serves as a valuable reference for understanding the mathematical models and concepts implemented in the project. It can be used to quickly look up key formulas and their interpretations to aid in better understanding the code and its underlying principles.

## InterferenceComputation.m File
The InterferenceComputation.m file, provided by Professor Andrea Detti, simulates the Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) in a cellular network. This function computes the SIR for both uplink and downlink transmissions based on several network parameters.

The function works by deploying the base stations (BS) and computing the SIR based on a hexagonal grid model using the DeployBS and FCA functions, simulating the network behavior for a given set of parameters.
